    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
      In Free Fire, players control a character in a third-person perspective
      and use a joystick to move. The fire button allows them to shoot and throw
      items. The character can perform actions such as jumping, crawling, and
      lying down. During gameplay, players can utilize the "Gloo Wall" grenade
      as a form of cover to protect against damage.

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>
      The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid- and
      low-specification phones", but a reviewer stated that "if games with good
      graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire
      Battlegrounds. But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun
      with your friends, you should definitely play." Tais Carvalho of Techtudo
      commented that Free Fire "prioritizes performance, making it a great
      choice for any type of device. The gameplay stands out and has enough
      content to entertain and offer rewarding combat." Regarding the
      progression of characters and skills, she said it is "a flashy add-on". In
      the Google Play annual list of "Best Apps of the Year", Free Fire won in
      the "Best Popular Vote Game" category of 2019, being the most publicly
      voted in Brazil and in Thailand. Garena Free Fire is one of the most
      popular battle royale mobile games, behind PUBG Mobile, Fortnite Battle
      Royale and Call of Duty: Mobile. It is particularly popular in Latin
      America, India and Southeast Asia. Free Fire was the fourth most
      downloaded game on the Google Play Store in the fourth quarter of 2018,
      and was the fourth most downloaded game worldwide in 2018 on iOS and the
      Google Play Store together. The title earned approximately 182 million
      downloads in 2018, making it the second most downloaded battle royale
      mobile game (above Fortnite Battle Royale and behind only PUBG Mobile),
      and grossed approximately $19.3 million in monthly revenues through
      December 2018, becoming a significant financial success for Garena. As of
      August 2021, Garena Free Fire has more than one billion downloads on the
      Google Play Store. At the end of Q1 2021, Free Fire surpassed PUBG Mobile
      in revenues in the United States, generating $100 million in turnover as
      compared to PUBG Mobile's $68 million. Free Fire's revenues jumped by 4.5
      times as compared to the same period for the previous year. By November
      2019, Free Fire had grossed over $1 billion worldwide. It went on to
      become the fourth highest-grossing video game of 2020 with $2.13 billion,
      and then the eighth highest-grossing mobile game of 2021 with $1.2
      billion, for a total of at least $4.33 billion grossed as of 2021. In 2020
      and 2021 Free Fire won the Esports Mobile Game of the Year award at the
